## General tips for dynamic meeting spaces
[Kumospace](#kumospace) and [Gather](#gather) are dynamic meeting spaces that aim to mimic natural social environments. Instead of taking turns speaking on a Zoom call, these platforms allow for multiple conversations to happen at the same time within the same virtual space. They do this by allowing users to navigate throughout a space at their own will, and only displaying audiovisual information for other users who are within a particular range. ***If you want to speak to someone in a dynamic meeting space, you need to navigate to their avatar in the space***.

I go into more detail on how to use the different platforms below. But here are some general tips:
- don't linger in the location you are placed when you land in the space.
- move conversations out of high-traffic areas --- don't be afraid to say "hey, why don't we move over here where it's a bit less crowded".
- use the Map features to locate individuals/groups you wish to speak with.
- make use of the objects in the space by "sitting" on couches, chairs, benches, etc.
- *for Gather specifically*: hold down the `g` key if you wish to hide audio & video from other users while you navigate from Point A to Point B, or if you want to walk through people/objects. this is my most recommended tip!

## Zoom
Zoom is a video chat platform that has become ubiquitous during the pandemic. Best practices include:
- muting your microphone while you are not speaking
- using the `Raise Hand` feature (on the bottom toolbar, click on `Reactions` > `Raise Hand`) when you want to ask a question
- using the `Lower Hand` feature (in the same location as `Raise Hand`) after your question has been answered

During the seminars especially, we encourage use of the annotation tool if you wish to make reference to something on the speaker's slides. Brief tutorial on how to use the annotation tool below:

## [Kumospace](https://kumospace.com/ssnap2021){:target="_blank"}
***Kumospace is not compatible with Safari and works best on a laptop/desktop.***

On Kumospace, each user appears as a small video window. Users can **navigate through the space using arrow keys** (recommended) or by clicking to the location you wish to move to. So don't be surprised if you click on some object out of curiosity and find yourself yanked out of a conversation with a colleague (but also don't feel bad if that happens, as it will inevitably happen to everyone at some point).

When you launch [Kumospace](https://kumospace.com/ssnap2021){:target="_blank"} for the very first time, you will be prompted to create an account. Since we will be using this platform regularly, I recommend making this account and saving the login information in your browser. This will also store your preferences for access to your video camera and microphone, though you can always toggle them on and off as needed.

After logging in, you will be shown a preview of your video over a yellow button that says `Join`. Clicking this button will lead you to the equivalent of a hallway, wherein you get an overview of the different rooms we have in the SSNAP Kumospace. Underneath each room is a number indicating how many individuals are in the room. As you might infer from the `30` in the denominator, rooms are capped at 30 individuals. **You can only speak with users who are in the same room as you, and you can only see who is in a room once you enter it**.

- To get a birds-eye view of who is in a room, click on the `People` icon on the bottom left.
- To navigate to someone in the room, click on the `Map` icon in the bottom right, locate their initials on the map, and navigate to that location.
  - Especially in the early days when you are still learning the layout of the spaces, I recommend keeping the `Map` up while you are navigating to help orient yourself.

If, after entering a room, you wish to see who is in the other room(s), you simply have to navigate to & click on the `Exit` button and you will be returned to the "hallway" page that gives the overview of the rooms.

I usually like to use Kumospace in its most zoomed-out view. If you also do this, it's possible that when you enter a new room the view will be slightly zoomed in, but will appear as though it is zoomed totally out. Clicking once on the zoom-in (`+`) button should fix this glitch.

Per my suggestions [above](#general-tips-for-dynamic-meeting-spaces), don't linger at the entrance when you enter into a room! Either navigate off to the side and use the `Map` to find people you wish to speak with, or simply explore the space naturally and see who you bump into. Kumospace defaults to presenting a small halo around your avatar indicating the extent of your audiovisual range:

<img src="../assets/img/kumo_maria.png" width=750 align=center>

If you wish to remove this, or to toggle other audiovisual things, click on the `Settings` icon in the toolbar. Some settings you might wish to toggle:
- `Play sound when someone enters room`: unchecking this will turn off the periodic doorbell sounds
- `Show range indicator`: unchecking this will remove the halo

The halo is helpful when you are starting out, and it can also explain why someone's audio is low. ***If someone is at the extreme of your range, their audio will be quieter***. So if you want to hear someone better, move closer to them (just like you would in real life!). Likewise with objects -- if you want to decrease (or remove) background music coming from pianos, jukeboxes, etc., move farther away from them.

You can safely ignore the other buttons. But in case you're curious, here's what they do:
- `Chat` allows you to send direct messages. It defaults to sending to the whole room, but you can toggle this by clicking on `Current Room` above the `Enter message` field and selecting who you wish to send the mesage to:

<img src="../assets/img/kumo_chat.png" width=200 class='center'>

- `Camera` turns your camera on/off
- `Microphone` does the same with your mic
- `Broadcast` shares your video with the whole room
- `Screenshare` is self-explanatory

## Crowdcast
Crowdcast is a virtual streaming platform. It allows for live streaming of video calls, time-stamped chat messages, and crowd-sourced questions for speakers. Both sessions of the [Closing Conference]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link schedule.md %}#week-three){:target="_blank"} will be hosted on Crowdcast.

The first time you open a Crowdcast link, you will be prompted to make an account. After making an account & logging in, you will be directed to the main "stage" where the conference talks will take place. It will look very similar to a Zoom meeting, with some key differences:

- The chat is automatically open. We encourage you to use it! But if you find it distracting, you can collapse the chat by hovering to the top right of the chat window and clicking on the downward arrow that appears

<img src="../assets/img/crowdcast_chat.png" width=350 class="center">

- Questions for the speakers should be asked using the "Ask a Question" feature in the bottom toolbar.
- We encourage upvoting questions that you would also like to see answered.
- There is also an option to reply to someone's question. We encourage doing this too! Especially if a question is clarificatory and is something that you have substantive knowledge about :)
- If you wish to rewind the recording to the moment someone said something in the chat, hover over the chat message and a green "play" icon will appear along with the prompt "Jump to moment". Clicking on the arrow will rewind the video to the moment that chat was sent.

## Gather
***Gather is not compatible with Safari and only works on a desktop/laptop (no tablets or mobile).***

*The space depicted in these screenshots might be different from the actual space we use for the meeting, but the principles hold across all Gather spaces.*

Jump to: [Navigating to a specific person](#navigating-to-a-specific-person) \| [Toolbar options](#toolbar-options) \|  [Chat](#using-the-chat)  

Gather is the dynamic meeting space we will use for larger social hours (i.e., any with an anticipated attendance > 30 people). On Gather, you are an avatar and you navigate the space using arrow keys. Your personal video appears in the bottom right of the screen, and the audio & video of other avatars in your proximity will appear at the top of your screen.

<img src="../assets/img/gather_lobby.png" width=750 class="center">

<p></p>

If you linger at the entrance, you should be prepared to have lots of peoples' audio & visual flash onto your screen -- this is why I recommend moving from the location where you enter as quickly as possible! Moving off to the side to give yourself some time to get your bearings can make a world of difference in the quality of your interactions and in your overall experience using Gather.

Perhaps there's someone specific you want to talk to? Make sure to read the section [navigating to a specific person](#navigating-to-a-specific-person). But after you've located that person, or after you've stumbled upon a group whose company you enjoy, you might wish to make the videochat experience a little more "videochat-y" instead of video game-y. You can click on the expand screen icon by the videos of the people you are talking with to expand the view to fullscreen:

<img src="../assets/img/gather_lobby_marked.png" width=750 class="center">

<img src="../assets/img/gather_fullscreen.png" width=750 class="center">


And now you have some semblance of a normal conversation! Shoutout to my mom and sister for helping me out with this :)

To re-minimize the videos, just click on the arrows to the right that I've highlighted in red. The larger the size of your group, the smaller each individual video window will be when you maximize the videos. If your group is especially large, Gather will do something similar to Zoom -- it will create "pages" of videos that you can arrow through, instead of trying to fit everyone's video onto the screen at once.

<br>

###### Not all distances are created equal
Our Gather space is equipped with ***Private spaces***. These are sub-spaces within the larger space that help facilitate smaller group conversations. While you are inside a private space, the only people with access to your audiovisual information (and vice versa) are those also in the private space. In the example below, `Malak` is as physically close to me as is possible in Gather but I don't see her video at the top of my screen (and she can't see mine either). If she were to step over into the private space (demarcated by the "rug" on the floor, and flagged to you by a brief message alerting you that `You are entering a private space`), then I'd be able to see and hear her exactly as I was before when we were just in the main space.

<img src="../assets/img/gather_private.png" width=750 class="center">

Private spaces are cool. Use them! They're basically the equivalent of moving a conversation off to the side, which is a [general best practice in dynamic meeting spaces](#general-tips-for-dynamic-meeting-spaces).

<br>

###### Navigating to a specific person
The easiest way to navigate to a specific person in Gather is to locate them on the `Participants` tab and then using Gather's built-in functionality to navigate to them. First, make sure that you have the `Participants` sidebar open. It should be open by default, but if not you can open it by clicking on the icon of 2 people on the bottom left of the screen.

<img src="../assets/img/gather_sidebar.png" width=750 class="center">
<p></p>

Once you have the participants tab open, click on the name of the person you wish to locate. This will generate a pop-up with **two** options:

<img src="../assets/img/gather_popup.png" width=450 class="center">

<p></p>

- **Locate on map** will generate a path you can follow to navigate directly to that person
- **Follow** will automatically navigate your avatar to that person, and will continue automatically following that person around the space until you click `Stop following` (it would appear in the same spot as `Stop locating` in the screenshot below).
- **Spotlight** is an option available to admins only -- ignore it in this screenshot!

Here is what you will see when you click `Locate on map`:

<img src="../assets/img/gather_locate.png" width=750 class="center">

<p></p>

I tend to use `Locate on map` instead of `Follow`, but you can use them at your discretion. The only difference is that when you use `Locate` you will have to physically follow that path (which updates based on your location, in case you wanted to make a pit-stop along the way), whereas `Follow` will automatically put your avatar on the shortest possible path between its current location and the location of the person you want to talk to.

One of the most stressful things about Gather, in my opinion, is all of the audiovisual information getting thrown in your face while you are navigating to someone you wish to speak to. ***Pressing the `g` key while navigating throughout Gather is the best piece of advice I have ever gotten***. It turns you into a "ghost" that can walk through people & objects, it prevents your video from appearing on other peoples' screens, and prevents others' video from appearing on your screen. If you're trapped in a crowd, navigating across the space, or just need some privacy off to the side, the `g` key is your best friend. Use it!

<br>

###### Toolbar options
I'm not sure if this little thing at the bottom of the screen is called a toolbar, but that's what I'm going to call it.
<img src="../assets/img/gather_menu.png" width=300 class="center">

- Clicking on the avatar allows you to modify your avatar's appearance and update your name
- Clicking on the map opens up a (not totally helpful) map
- Clicking on the monitor allows you to screenshare
- Clicking on the smiley face opens options for "reactions", similar to those you would see on Zoom

Clicking on your name will open up a sub-menu that looks like this:
<img src="../assets/img/gather_menu_options.png" width=450 class="center">

- `Edit` allows you to modify your display name
- You can set a status by typing into the status bar. Fellows are encouraged to use this field to indicate their role as a fellow so that speakers can know who to navigate to. And I set mine as Program Coordinator so that I am easy to find!
- `User/Video Preferences` allows you to tweak some technical things. If you want to hold a conversation while on a separate tab, then you should uncheck the option `Auto Idle Muting` under `User/Video Preferences`
- `Turn on Quiet Mode` shrinks the diameter of your range so that only those in your immediate vicinity will be able to see and hear you.
- `Reset Position` removes you from your current position and places you in a random starting location.
- `Sign Out` is self-explanatory.

<br>

###### Using the chat
Right above the `Participants` icon is a `Chat` icon. Clicking on this will displace the `Participants` window with a `Chat` window (unlike Zoom, where they stack!). You have 3 options for the chat:

<img src="../assets/img/gather_chat.png" width=200 class="center">

- `Nearby`, the default setting, will send a chat to everyone within your range (so, anyone whose video you can currently see)
- `Everyone` will send a chat to everyone in the space
- `Malak` (or any other name) will send a direct message to the person whose name you select

You can also send someone a direct message by typing in the `Message...` field that pops up when you click their name on the `Participants` tab. This is probably the easiest way to send a direct message to someone.

###### FAQs & Troubleshooting

Is there a problem you ran into that I didn't anticipate on this page? Let me know and I'll add it to the FAQs!

For now, here's some information on how to grant different web apps permission to your camera & microphone if you mistakenly rejected access previously. Made for Chrome users, but is probably a similar process in Firefox.

1. On the far right of your browser, click on the three dots to the right of your Google profile photo
2. Click `Settings`
3. Click `Privacy and Security` on the left-hand menu
4. Click 'Site settings'
5. Scroll to whatever is broken -- whether it be `Camera` or `Microphone` -- and click on it
6. `Search` for the site that you are having trouble with
7. Click on the small rightward-facing arrow on the same line as the website
8. From the drop-down in the line for the modality that is broken, select either `Allow` or `Ask`
9. Go back to the site tab & refresh the page. It should be working now.
