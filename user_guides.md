## General tips for dynamic meeting spaces
[Kumospace](#kumospace) and [Gather](#gather) are dynamic meeting spaces that aim to mimic natural social environments. Instead of taking turns speaking on a Zoom call, these platforms allow for multiple conversations to happen at the same time within the same virtual space. They do this by allowing users to navigate throughout a space at their own will, and only displaying audiovisual information for other users who are within a particular range. ***If you want to speak to someone in a dynamic meeting space, you need to navigate to their avatar in the space***.

I go into more detail on how to use the different platforms below. But here are some general tips:
- don't linger in the location you are placed when you land in the space.
- use the Map features to locate individuals/groups you wish to speak with.
- move conversations out of high-traffic areas --- don't be afraid to say "hey, why don't we move over here where it's a bit less crowded".
- make use of the objects in the space by "sitting" on couches, chairs, benches, etc.
- *for Gather specifically*: hold down the `g` key if you wish to hide audio & video from other users while you navigate from Point A to Point B. this is my most recommended tip!

## Zoom
Zoom is a video chat platform that has become ubiquitous during the pandemic. Best practices include:
- muting your microphone while you are not speaking
- using the "Raise Hand" feature (on the bottom toolbar, click on Reactions > Raise Hand) when you want to ask a question

During the seminars especially, we encourage use of the annotation tool if you wish to make reference to something on the speaker's slides. Brief tutorial on how to use the annotation tool below:

## [Kumospace](https://kumospace.com/ssnap2021){:target="_blank"}
***Kumospace is not compatible with Safari and works best on a laptop/desktop.***

On Kumospace, each user appears as a small video window. Users can **navigate through the space using arrow keys** (recommended) or by clicking to the location you wish to move to. So don't be surprised if you click on some object out of curiosity and find yourself yanked out of a conversation with a colleague (but also don't feel bad if that happens, as it will inevitably happen to everyone at some point).

When you launch [Kumospace](https://kumospace.com/ssnap2021){:target="_blank"} for the very first time, you will be prompted to create an account. Since we will be using this platform regularly, I recommend making this account and saving the login information in your browser. This will also store your preferences for access to your video camera and microphone, though you can always toggle them on and off as needed.

After logging in, you will be shown a preview of your video over a yellow button that says `Join`. Clicking this button will lead you to the equivalent of a hallway, wherein you get an overview of the different rooms we have in the SSNAP Kumospace. Underneath each room is a number indicating how many individuals are in the room. As you might infer from the `30` in the denominator, rooms are capped at 30 individuals. **You can only speak with users who are in the same room as you, and you can only see who is in a room once you enter it**.

To get a birds-eye view of who is in a room, click on the `People` icon on the bottom left. To navigate to someone in the room, click on the `Map` icon in the bottom right, locate their initials on the Map, and navigate to that location. Especially in the early days when you are still learning the layout of the spaces, I recommend keeping the `Map` up while you are navigating to help orient yourself. If, after entering a room, you wish to see who is in the other room(s), you simply have to navigate to & click on the `Exit` button and you will be returned to the "hallway" page that gives the overview of the rooms.

Per my suggestions [above](#general-tips-for-dynamic-meeting-spaces), don't linger at the entrance when you enter into a room! Either navigate off to the side and use the Map to find people you wish to speak with, or simply explore the space naturally and see who you bump into. Kumospace defaults to presenting a small halo around your avatar indicating the extent of your audiovisual range:

If you wish to remove this, or to toggle other audiovisual things, click on the `Settings` icon in the toolbar.

The halo is helpful when you are starting out, and it can also explain why someone's audio is low. ***If someone is at the extreme of your range, their audio will be quieter***. So if you want to hear someone better, move closer to them (just like you would in real life!). Likewise with objects -- if you want to decrease (or remove) background music coming from pianos, jukeboxes, etc., move farther away from them.

## Crowdcast
Crowdcast is a virtual streaming platform. It allows for live streaming of video calls, time-stamped chat messages, and crowd-sourced questions for speakers. Both sessions of the [Closing Conference]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link schedule.md %}#week-three){:target="_blank"} will be hosted on Crowdcast.

The first time you open a Crowdcast link, you will be prompted to make an account. After making an account & logging in, you will be directed to the main "stage" where the conference talks will take place. It will look very similar to a Zoom meeting, with some key differences:

- The chat is automatically open. We encourage you to use it! But if you find it distracting, you can collapse the chat by hovering to the top right of the chat window and clicking on the downward arrow that appears

- Questions for the speakers should be asked using the "Ask a Question" feature in the bottom toolbar.
- We encourage voting on questions that you would also like to see answered.
- There is also an option to reply to someone's question. We encourage doing this too! Especially if a question is clarificatory and is something that you have substantive knowledge about :)
- If you wish to rewind the recording to the moment someone said something in the chat, hover over the chat message and a green "play" icon will appear along with the prompt "Jump to moment". Clicking on the arrow will rewind the video to the moment that chat was sent.

## Gather
Gather is the dynamic meeting space we will use for larger social hours (i.e., any with an anticipated attendance > 30 people).
