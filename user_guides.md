*If you read one thing on this page, please let it be the section on **[Gather](#gather)**. Many find this the most overwhelming and confusing platform. These tips help appease that.*

#### Zoom
Zoom is a video chat platform that has become ubiquitous during the pandemic. Best practices include:
- muting your microphone while you are not speaking
- using the "Raise Hand" feature (on the bottom toolbar, click on Reactions > Raise Hand) when you want to ask a question

During the seminars especially, we encourage use of the annotation tool if you wish to make reference to something on the speaker's slides. Brief tutorial on how to use the annotation tool below:

#### Kumospace [[link](https://kumospace.com/ssnap2021)]
This is a dynamic meeting space that will remain open throughout the entirety of the meeting. It is where we will meet for pre- and post-seminar social hours. Up to 30 users can fit in a room at a time, but you should feel free to branch into other rooms if you are curious or want more privacy!
