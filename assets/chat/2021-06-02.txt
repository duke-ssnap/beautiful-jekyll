12:30:17	 From Jessica Thompson : What about auditory contributions?
12:37:41	 From Felipe De Brigard : They know what it is like to be a bat!
13:08:34	 From Maria Khoudary : this is a friendly and charitable group!
13:20:30	 From Jessica Thompson : No representation without computation ;)
13:20:54	 From Raphael Gerraty : +1
13:21:00	 From Corey Maley, Ph.D. (he/him/his) : ^^^^!!!
13:21:54	 From Jenn Lee : And no taxation without representationâ€¦!
13:22:12	 From Jessica Thompson : ðŸ¤£
13:22:16	 From Austin A. Baker : Bahaha
13:23:09	 From Raphael Gerraty : so like no taxation without computation??
13:24:02	 From Maria Khoudary : yep!
13:26:24	 From Maria Khoudary : anyone know if people have looked at the Perky effect in patients like DF?
13:35:37	 From Trey Boone : Adina Roskies recently published a paper that pushes back on that fwiw
13:35:40	 From Trey Boone : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349188638_Representational_similarity_analysis_in_neuroimaging_proxy_vehicles_and_provisional_representations
13:37:04	 From Austin A. Baker : Omg, I walked down stairs to find the SSNAP shirt package had arrived.
13:37:25	 From Brian Earp : ðŸ˜€
13:50:27	 From Maria Khoudary : me too!
13:50:31	 From Jessica Thompson : Me tooo
13:51:25	 From Raphael Gerraty : is this specific to neuroscience? it seems like philosophers use the same two approaches
14:14:45	 From Maria Khoudary  To  Felipe De Brigard(privately) : lol weâ€™re basically just in the Q&A now
14:18:02	 From Jessica Thompson : Letâ€™s go sledding!
14:18:34	 From Austin A. Baker : â€˜Representingâ€™ Rutgers! ;-)
14:19:44	 From Bradford Mahon : +psychology!
14:22:34	 From Bradford Mahon : i muted him
14:22:44	 From Felipe De Brigard : Thanks!
14:38:51	 From Lara Krisst : This the disjunctivist view? Are you sympathetic to this view?
14:47:29	 From Nick Byrd : Susanna seems to have lots of experiences with the philosophical differences between philosophers and neuroscientists. I wonder if there are plans to study the generalizability and individual differences of these philosophical differences. If not, there seems to be an opportunity to study these differences in a more quantitative way. (More of a comment than a questionâ€”sorry.)
14:56:25	 From Jessica Thompson : I have one of those embarrassing questions: I donâ€™t understand what supervene means
14:56:30	 From Maria Khoudary : +1
14:56:51	 From Maria Khoudary : letâ€™s make sure to tell Marc Lange to cover both of these next year :)
14:57:24	 From Bradford Mahon : my understanding: x supervenes on y if x canâ€™t be different unless y is different (is that right?)
14:57:35	 From Corey Maley, Ph.D. (he/him/his) : Yep!
14:57:53	 From Jessica Thompson : Ty!
15:01:46	 From Nick Byrd : Need to step away until social hour. Lovely talks!
15:04:18	 From Raphael Gerraty : if y=f(x) is a computation that is optimized for some function L(y), then y can be closer to or further from the global minimum of L(y). is that enough to make y a representation? We can evaluate it with L right?
15:05:01	 From Jessica Thompson : This feels like such an impossible topic to do justice to, especially if you are trying to not just present your own view, so mega props to Dr. Schellenberg for tackling it for us.
15:05:16	 From Corey Maley, Ph.D. (he/him/his) : +1
15:05:19	 From Raphael Gerraty : yes thank you so much!!!
15:05:22	 From Austin A. Baker : ^ yup! Read her book!
15:08:55	 From Maria Khoudary : https://kumospace.com/ssnap2021
15:09:51	 From Lara Krisst : Thank you both!
15:09:55	 From Bradford Mahon : thank you all!
15:09:59	 From Brian Earp : Thank you!
15:10:09	 From Susanna Schellenberg : Thank you everyone!
