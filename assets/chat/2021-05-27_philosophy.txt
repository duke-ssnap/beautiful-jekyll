11:33:00	 From Adam Safron : happy to listen
11:56:25	 From Felipe De Brigard : Need to step out for a sec

12:50:39	 From Maria Khoudary : the causal relevance of absences is at least one motivating factor for preferring counterfactual theories to process theories
12:50:51	 From Maria Khoudary : or at least that’s what people in my lab think
12:51:20	 From Raphael Gerraty : "the absence absences"
12:51:36	 From Maria Khoudary : Paul Henne
12:51:51	 From Maria Khoudary : but that’s on causal reasoning in humans
12:51:59	 From Maria Khoudary : and not on causation proper / as a metaphysical concept
12:52:42	 From Maria Khoudary : shameless plug for Paul’s episode of my radio show: https://mariakhoudary.com/default_mode/#paul. this is the bulk of what we talked about

13:46:18	 From Maria Khoudary : if you’re sympathetic to arguments that causation doesn’t exist, you might also be sympathetic to the argument that causation is a response-dependent property (like color)
13:57:06	 From Felipe De Brigard : Thanks again Dave! Going to step out for about 20 minutes to go pick up my children. Thanks again!
14:01:58	 From Lara Krisst : Thank you!
