13:09:44	 From Zina Ward : ^ cool!!
13:13:48	 From Kristen Lindquist : Except they are all the same pills!
13:19:29	 From Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, Ph.D. : If so, that might be why the pills work in some cases but not others.
13:32:39	 From Maria Khoudary : he was also a full-time PI :)
14:11:02	 From Nick Byrd : Are the top 5-10% of slides cropped out for anyone else? (So far it hasn’t really prevented me from understanding. Just troubleshooting.)
14:11:59	 From Maria Khoudary : they are for me too but also haven’t gotten in the way of understanding
14:22:15	 From Brian Earp : “Hangry!”
14:39:01	 From Felipe De Brigard : Going to switch wi-fis! BRB!
14:46:45	 From Felipe De Brigard : Maybe in Italy!
14:58:13	 From Adam Safron : Emotion as action side and Feeling as perception side of organismic action-perception cycles, both of which could be either conscious or unconscious?
15:03:46	 From Adam Safron : I definitely feel like my experience of emotion is strongly influenced by the way I'm categorizing/conceptualizing it, but I also feel like I'm getting a lot of quasi-Jamesian driving by pre-conscious reactions to my somatic states.The lack of objective discriminability of emotional experiences from somatic states (even using multi-variate methods) is intriguing. Although I also wonder if the signals available to the person/organism are far richer, and where the d' is actually a lot more reliable for the perceptual inferences of individual experiencers measuring themselves from within.
15:09:20	 From Adam Safron : Although this might be missing the point of those studies in pointing to the context-sensitive nature of the meanings/experiences, making any given set of somatic responses (from whatever origin) only part of what contributes to emotional consciousness.
15:09:50	 From Maria Khoudary : join us in the “social hour space” after this! https://kumospace.com/ssnap2021
15:15:04	 From Kristen Lindquist : @Adam I’m very interested in the question of whether emotions are similar to somatic states—would love to follow up at some point!
