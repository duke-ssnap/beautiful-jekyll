12:13:43	 From Lara Krisst : Here! Will show video momentarily
12:16:25	 From Adam Safron : I'm in a noisy place at the moment, so sorry to not introduce myself verbally: I'm a neuroscientist and psychologist interested in consciousness and free will.
12:17:55	 From Adam Safron : (thank you)
12:19:11	 From Megha Chawla (she/her) : Sorry I’m off video and on mute for ~20 more mins while I’m in the car. I’m a graduate student in the psychology program at Yale and interested in the neuroscience of social decision making!
13:18:50	 From Lara Krisst : I’m here
13:21:15	 From Adam Safron : I'm a little perplexed by behaviorism. I feel things all the time without overt behavior. I can understand an epistemic norm requiring objective observability, but I'm confused how this could become a criterion for the ontological status of mental phenomena.
13:22:16	 From Adam Safron : that does seem like progress. of a kind...
13:26:37	 From Adam Safron : seems like a not bad prior, but fallacious if made axiomatic
13:27:45	 From Adam Safron : I'd expect some kind of homomorphism between the subjective and physical implementation, but I wouldn't want to go too far with that
13:29:32	 14:02:41	 From Maria Khoudary : for the record i don’t think my suggestion is a compelling argument against functionalism! i was just curious if anyone had been brave enough to stick their neck out that far
14:03:21	 From Felipe De Brigard : BRB!
14:05:08	 From Maria Khoudary : not that different from how some people do science :)
14:57:39	 From Jessica Thompson : I feel like multiple realizability is really fundamental. I don’t see how one could feasibly reject multiple realizability even if it feels like there are good criticisms of various versions of functionalism.
14:58:32	 From Felipe De Brigard : How about minimal functionalism, via multiple realizability in principle, but almost impossible in practice? (Or very limited, in practice?)
14:58:38	 From Maria Khoudary : you should talk to Trey about it! his dissertation was on responses to multiple realizability
15:00:18	 From Jessica Thompson : Minimal functionalism: maybe? Not sure. But anything beyond that seems like you are positing some “magic” of the physical components of bodies/brains/neurons
15:01:34	 From Jessica Thompson : I’m more willing to abandon consciousness than multiple realizability
15:05:00	 From Maria Khoudary : what if the “magic” is millions of years of evolutionary design?
15:05:44	 From Maria Khoudary : that we don’t really have good tools to reverse engineer yet
15:11:13	 From Daina Crafa : Thanks so much!
15:11:22	 From Lara Krisst : Thank you!!
15:11:28	 From Megha Chawla (she/her) : Thank you!!
15:11:41	 From Adam Safron : thank you :)
