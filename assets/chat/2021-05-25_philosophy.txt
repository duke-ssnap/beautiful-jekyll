12:08:45	 From Adam Safron : I'm a neuroscientist interested in consciousness and free will. (Sorryto h my camera is off.)
12:09:04	 From Adam Safron : *to have my camera off
12:54:55	 From Maria Khoudary : another review this paper got is that it was too “incremental” of a result
12:55:26	 From Maria Khoudary : theoretic anarchism!!!
13:26:32	 From Jessica Thompson : A candidate implicit assumption of modern neuroscience: that characterizing what a neuron responds selectively to his relevant for understanding the functional role of that neuron.
13:27:10	 From Felipe De Brigard : I like that, Jessica!
13:27:38	 From Felipe De Brigard : The action potential assumption sounds important to me too.
13:28:33	 From Felipe De Brigard : Neurons do much more than just generate an action potential out of the axon hillock. There are crabs cycles inside, enzymatic organization, enzymatic transmission through neuronal gap junctures, etc.
13:29:26	 From Felipe De Brigard : What not think that all those other metabolic activities, than need not be totally correlated with action potentials, aren’t relevant for cognition?
13:30:19	 From Raphael Gerraty : another potential one: memory = LTP?
13:30:43	 From Felipe De Brigard : Good one!
13:31:18	 From Felipe De Brigard : Specially since there is LTP in so many areas of the brain, outside of the MTL
13:44:48	 From Adam Safron : is khun claiming that no 'progress' is made across paradigms?
13:45:08	 From Adam Safron : all equally good, just for different contexts?
13:47:12	 From Adam Safron : reminds me of piaget in terms of assimilation vs accommodation of new knowledge
13:49:46	 From Lara Krisst : Another potential one: perception is veridical
14:22:08	 From Maria Khoudary : i think the “rise to legitimacy” that we’re witnessing for consciousness science is a good example of what Lara was talking about
14:22:23	 From Maria Khoudary : or like one way that a previously fringe topic is slowly breaking in
14:34:32	 From Maria Khoudary : Helen Longino
14:34:47	 From Maria Khoudary : she is one of my favorite philosophers of all time :)
14:35:11	 From Felipe De Brigard : She’s amazing
14:42:02	 From Maria Khoudary : probably because there wasn’t infrastructure for data sharing when journals first started
14:42:20	 From Maria Khoudary : and there’s no centralized practice or software for doing data analysis
14:42:47	 From Maria Khoudary : its quite likely that a given reviewer might not even understand the code that someone used to run a test
14:44:05	 From Maria Khoudary : i think this is another dimension contributing to this bizarre phenomenon where people personally identify with their favorite theory of their explanatory target
14:45:18	 From Maria Khoudary : expected or desired? haha
14:47:23	 From Maria Khoudary : i think he’s now a monist?
14:47:46	 From Maria Khoudary : but people use his view to support substance dualism
14:51:01	 From Maria Khoudary : it’s an emergent property!
14:53:07	 From Maria Khoudary : the same foundation funding SSNAP is funding an adversarial collaboration on theories of consciousness :)
14:53:51	 From David Lydon-Staley (he/him) : Maria and Felipe have the same brain :)
14:53:57	 From Megha Chawla (she/her) : ^^
14:54:30	 From Maria Khoudary : GWT and HOT too!
14:54:41	 From Maria Khoudary : my new PI is a big contributor on that project
14:54:46	 From Maria Khoudary : (megan peters)
14:56:10	 From Maria Khoudary : do the consciousness scientists in the room know about this too? https://sites.google.com/uci.edu/fundconsciousness
14:56:40	 From Lara Krisst : Great endevour.
14:57:05	 From Felipe De Brigard : The authors of the theories participate in the experimental design
14:58:47	 From Maria Khoudary : we might end up refining the theories as an outcome
14:58:57	 From Maria Khoudary : instead of just straight up abandoning
14:59:31	 From Maria Khoudary : and fwiw the teams are quite large
14:59:40	 From Maria Khoudary : there are like 10-12 people named on the grant docs
15:01:20	 From Raphael Gerraty : here's an example of critical reviews of a specific adversarial collaboration that i think doesn't work: https://openreview.net/forum?id=hdM6XsRIWHr
15:01:38	 From Adam Safron : It won't.
15:02:02	 From Adam Safron : I hope I'm wrong.
15:02:30	 From Lara Krisst : Thank you!
15:02:55	 From Daina Crafa : Thanks for the great talk!
15:03:00	 From Jessica Thompson : Thank you so much! #TeamLongino
