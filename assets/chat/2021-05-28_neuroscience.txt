31:44	 From Corey Maley, Ph.D. (he/him/his) : I often quote the very first line of this book: “The brain computes!”
13:58:11	 From Brian Earp : this is why i don’t go to the gym
14:00:12	 From Nick Byrd : Couldn’t merely imaging the reward provide some semblance of a reward? Also, isn’t it rewarding to achieve subgoals (e.g., doing one workout on way to marathon)?
14:05:55	 From Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, Ph.D. : Maybe that is why I have never run a marathon. I lack imagination of the reward and so did not find it rewarding to finish a workout where I ran out of steam after 10 miles.
15:05:15	 From Austin A. Baker : Thanks so much!
