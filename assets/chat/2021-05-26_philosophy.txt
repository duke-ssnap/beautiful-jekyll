12:07:32	 From Megha Chawla (she/her) : I will have to leave early today — apologies in advance!
12:18:22	 From Adam Safron : Would it be possible for someone to send me a link to the slides?
12:18:51	 From Maria Khoudary : just re-sent you the email!
12:18:59	 From Maria Khoudary : they’re not on the internet so i can’t link
12:19:02	 From Adam Safron : thank you :)
12:42:18	 From Maria Khoudary : i’ve often thought that the messiness of the visual system is proof of the fact that we are not intelligently designed :)
12:58:54	 From Adam Safron : if we extend natural selection to work with differential persistence, relaxing the assumption of exponential increases via duplication, could a case be made that generalized darwinism is a theory of everything?
13:01:52	 From Megha Chawla (she/her) : Sorry to have to leave! Thanks Alex — this has been riveting thus far
13:02:20	 From Felipe De Brigard : I had to memorize them too, but in Spanish! lol
14:04:53	 From Lara Krisst : I’m here, will turn camera on in a moment.
14:07:43	 From Raphael Gerraty : a different theory of grid cells, in case anyone is interested: https://www.gwern.net/docs/rl/2017-stachenfeld.pdf
14:33:03	 From Jessica Thompson : Maybe we could imagine a trait that is somehow “malfunctioning” but where that wouldn’t affect the descriptive function of that trait. Like whether a trait is doing a good or bad job doesn’t change what it’s job is?
14:41:35	 From Maria Khoudary : “Skinnerian learning” comes from Dennett’s “Tower of Generate and Test.” it’s a fun framework for thinking about evolution. i don’t have a source for where he delineates it but you should look it up if you’re interested!
14:43:35	 From Felipe De Brigard : Likely from “kinds of mind"
15:03:47	 From Lara Krisst : That was brilliant, thank you.
15:03:48	 From Daina Crafa : This was a very interesting talk! Thank you so much! I will likely be thinking about many of your points for some time to come.
15:04:20	 From Raphael Gerraty : for the instrumental view, why not think that descriptions at all the levels are useful approximations?  why wouldn't that be real science?
