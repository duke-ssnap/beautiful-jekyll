12:07:12	 From Zina Ward : Excuses, excuses
12:07:20	 From Corey Maley : Mmm hmm.
12:07:23	 From Felipe De Brigard : ðŸ˜‚
12:46:33	 From Jessica Thompson : I just see a blank slide, is that right?
12:46:35	 From Jenn Lee : Me too
12:46:40	 From Jessica Thompson : Oh never mind
13:14:40	 From Corey Maley : Good question.
13:17:40	 From Adam Safron : How much 1st and 2nd person selfhood needs to be bootstrapped from dyadic interactions with parents before children are able to engage in these cooperative tasks at 3 years old?
13:18:28	 From Jessica Thompson : IIRC theory of mind develops around the same age. Is theory of mind required for these behaviours? Anyone remember at what age ToM can be observed?
13:19:00	 From Adam Safron : When do children pass this test?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally%E2%80%93Anne_test
13:19:44	 From Adam Safron : 3?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_mountain_problem
13:20:17	 From Adam Safron : To what extent do cooperative motives depend on emotional contagion for their expression?
13:22:43	 From Adam Safron : Another hypothesis bites the dust.
13:24:00	 From Adam Safron : I could be mistaken, but this account of cooperative motives seems to assume the very cognitive abilities that are bootstrapped from the cooperative acts requiring those motives.
13:24:29	 From Adam Safron : It's not clear we can just appeal to evolutionary priors to resolve this. How? By what neural mechanisms?
13:28:43	 From Adam Safron : How much perspective-taking virtuosity (cf. mirroring?) do we need to engage in these kinds of cooperative tasks, and what are the particular ways in which these capacities are elaborated in the context of such cooperative acts? Once again, I wonder the extent to which parents play a foundational role in scaffolding these capacities as part of a well-'designed' learning curriculum.
13:30:32	 From Adam Safron : Pointing and reaching and soliciting help from parents (with these acts being behaviorally shaped by parents) as the initial toehold in the intersubjective bootstrapping process?
13:35:20	 From Adam Safron : I really want to get a better understanding of the conditions under which we move from 2nd person to 3rd person perspective. 3rd person point of  view as invariance across many different simulated other perspectives in 2nd person contexts? Derived from 3-person cooperative tasks? Or do parents/teachers play an important role as watchers/judges/game-theoretic-mechanism-designers of simpler dyadic interactions, and where these normative perspectives from on high (literally from above) become internalized with experience?
13:44:02	 From Corey Maley : Maybe we could call this the problem of moral progress being impossible (strictly speaking) without moral realism?
13:44:23	 From Adam Safron : If we think of morality as reifications of mechanism design for favorable game theoretic equilibria, then they would could have a ((usually context-specific) relationally) realist ontological status as implicit mathematical objects floating in the ethereal fevered dreams of Plato's philosopher king.
13:49:15	 From Adam Safron : But how does the reification of otherwise pragmatic/instrumental values come about, developmentally speaking? Is it because of the nearly universal applicability of the principles governing successful cooperative interactions? In terms of quasi-theological intuitions (and perhaps their ultimate evolutionary-developmental sources), to what extent does the reification of norms emerge because of power asymmetries with parents and later surrogate (hopefully benevolent) authority figures?
13:49:29	 From Austin A. Baker : So the acceptance of the normal norm has to be on the societal level rather than the individual level for them to be morally obliged?
13:50:02	 From Austin A. Baker : *moral norm
13:52:29	 From Austin A. Baker : Great! Thatâ€™s super helpfulâ€”thanks to both of you!
13:57:14	 From Lara Krisst : That was part of what my question was getting at.
14:05:24	 From Adam Safron : I'm really compelled by the idea Jenn just brought up. Seems like we would likely be dealing with circular causation where universally applicable hypothetical imperatives become 'encoded'/'embodied' in linguistic expressions, which then further facilitate their cognitive and behavioral expression by organizing experience into frames of (both overt and covert) sense-making consistent with following/realizing those imperatives.
14:05:53	 From Jessica Thompson : This doesnâ€™t seem to be able to accommodate obligations (of humans) to nonhuman entities like the environment, the land, the water, plants, animals, ecosystems, etc.
14:12:01	 From Adam Safron : I'm having some trouble thinking of biologically plausible mechanisms for innate ingroup/outgroup intuitions-sentiments.To what degree are they mediated by the incorporation or exclusion of others from (extended) body schemas?Interpretations of  the functional significance of oxytocin?
