12:08:49	 From Adam Safron : Unfortunately I'll need to turn the camera off in a few minutes to move to another location (but will keep listening by phone), but I'll turn it back on when I can. Sorry about that.
12:10:35	 From Felipe De Brigard : NP
12:48:06	 From Lara Krisst : Sorry internet blipped out.
13:19:58	 From Lara Krisst : Sorry, I have to shut camera for a moment, but I am listening. Thank you.
13:24:18	 From Adam Safron : I'm still in transit, but at some point I'd love to talk about logical positivism and Russell's project.
13:39:51	 From Jessica Thompson : This feels very relevant for dealing with the “I’m just being rational” bros who like to pretend that there are no values, only facts
13:42:21	 From Felipe De Brigard : Rational is an extraordinarily normative term, I think.
13:42:48	 From Felipe De Brigard : Definitively agree with you
13:46:01	 From Daina Crafa : This example is really useful from a neuroscience perspective - thank you! :-)
13:52:52	 From Daina Crafa : Apologies - I must stop the camera for a minute but I’m still listening. Fallacies are fun!
14:00:05	 From Felipe De Brigard : Arbitrary boundaries!!!
14:05:37	 From Felipe De Brigard : Also, premise 1 is false. lol
14:16:54	 From Lara Krisst : Generalization fallacy
14:18:04	 From Raphael Gerraty : there's also a hidden ought?
14:19:22	 From Jenn Lee : Reminds me of “Absence of evidence isn’t evidence of absence”
14:55:15	 From Raphael Gerraty : add a couple more layers and you might bring down cognitivism!
15:02:13	 From Adam Safron : Regarding toothbrushes:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpty_Dumpty#Lewis_Carroll's_Through_the_Looking-Glass
15:02:30	 From Daina Crafa : Thank you for the great talk! I really enjoyed it! Many of the examples are quite useful for improving scientific argumentation, and I will continue to think about them
15:02:52	 From Lara Krisst : Thank you!!
